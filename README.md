# GottaDo
GottaDo is a simple to-do list app for iOS. Tasks appear within the Today list or the Backlog list. Tasks can be created, completed, reordered, moved between lists, renamed, flagged, and deleted.

My preferred workflow: 
1. At the start of the day, review all Backlog tasks. Keep the Backlog prioritized or small enough to easily scan.
2. Create today's plan by moving tasks out of the Backlog. Find that sweet spot of ambitious + realistic.
3. As tasks are completed, swipe to cross them off. Admire all those completed tasks.
4. At the end of the day, move incomplete tasks back to the Backlog (or leave them in Today to feel like a failure.)

In other words, 1-day Sprints.

## Motivation
1. I've been looking for a chance to learn and use Swift. 
2. I love to-do lists. Occasionally I'll add an already-completed task to a list just for the satisfaction of crossing it off. ~Write Motivation section~

## Status
As of mid-2019, GottaDo is my day-to-day to-do list app. Mission accomplished. I don't have any significant changes planned, however, I'll continue to maintain the app and make minor adjustments.

- Written in Swift 5
